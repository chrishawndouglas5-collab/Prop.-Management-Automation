# PropAuto Domain Requirements

Please paste the domain requirements (DNS records, verification tokens, etc.) below this line.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure the following information is clearly available across your domain(s):

A clear description of your product or service
Pricing details or a pricing page (a screenshot is acceptable if not yet available)
Key features or deliverables included with the purchase
Terms and Conditions, Refund Policy, and Privacy Policy (these must be clearly accessible via navigation on your website)
Include the company name or sole proprietor’s brand (legal name preferred for sole proprietors) in the Terms & Conditions
Site must be live and secured with an SSL certificate (HTTPS)
Custom/enterprise pricing sheet (if applicable)*
*This should be available as a downloadable PDF or document that can be provided to our team on request.

This information may be spread across your main domain and subdomains but must be easy to locate.

Only submit domains that are directly related to the product you’re selling via Paddle. If the domain includes unrelated products not sold through Paddle, it may lead to buyer confusion and a higher risk of chargebacks, which can impact approval.

You should submit each domain and subdomain you plan to launch a checkout from, but only one approved domain is required to move forward with verification.

Failing to include the required information may result in delays to your domain review.
